The artifact I selected is a project originally developed during my CS 320 course in August 2024. It implements full CRUD functionality for managing contacts, tasks, and appointments in Java, supported by a comprehensive JUnit testing suite. The original design followed modular architecture and domain-driven principles, and I have since enhanced it to incorporate more advanced data structures and database integration.

I chose this artifact because it demonstrates my growth in software engineering, data management, and full-stack development. For the third and final enhancement, I integrated MongoDB to provide persistent, scalable storage for managing contacts, tasks, and appointments. I also developed a functional frontend using Handlebars to connect seamlessly to the backend and database. These changes demonstrate my ability to adapt an existing application to include new technologies, implement database integration, and design a user interface that enables real-world interaction with the system.

I successfully met the course outcomes I had planned for this enhancement. The application now fully integrates MongoDB for data persistence, includes a functional UI, and ensures data integrity and security through the original validation mechanisms I maintained.

This process was a valuable learning experience. While I had used MongoDB a few times before, this was my first time incorporating it into an existing, fully functional application from the ground up. I gained confidence in designing and implementing database-backed systems and strengthened my skills in connecting backend services to a frontend interface. The biggest challenge I faced was time management. I underestimated the effort required to build the frontend, particularly in ensuring smooth interaction between the UI and backend. This experience has sharpened my ability to estimate project timelines more accurately in the future.
