The artifact I selected is a project I originally developed during my CS 320 course in August 2024. The project focused on implementing CRUD functionality for managing contacts, tasks, and appointments in Java, alongside a comprehensive testing suite built using JUnit.

I chose this artifact for my ePortfolio because it aligns well with all three steps of my enhancement plan and demonstrates a broad range of my skills as a software developer. Through the enhancements, I have successfully converted the entire project from Java to Node.js with an Express backend. This conversion highlights my adaptability in working with different programming languages and frameworks, as well as my ability to port existing functionality into a more modern and modular architecture. Additionally, I improved the artifact by refactoring it into a more modular design, applying encapsulation principles, and enhancing validation mechanisms to improve security and maintainability.

I believe I met the course outcomes I planned to achieve with this enhancement. The process of rebuilding and extending the artifact has strengthened my understanding of software engineering principles and best practices. While I am satisfied with the testing I have completed, I recognize that there is still room for improvement in creating more comprehensive test coverage, which could help uncover additional edge cases or vulnerabilities. If time permits, I plan to enhance the testing suite further.

The process of enhancing and modifying this artifact taught me that even seemingly simple tasks can become complex and time-consuming. I initially expected the conversion to Node.js to be straightforward, but it required a deeper understanding of both the original logic and the new framework to ensure accuracy and maintainability. I also learned the value of creating modular, reusable code by separating helper functions into utilities that could be shared across multiple files. The greatest challenge I encountered was time management, as the enhancements required far more time and effort than I anticipated. Nonetheless, the experience improved both my technical proficiency and my problem-solving approach when transitioning projects between languages and platforms.
