The artifact I selected is a project originally developed during my CS 320 course in August 2024. It implements CRUD functionality for managing contacts, tasks, and appointments using Java, and includes a comprehensive JUnit testing suite. The project was designed with modular architecture and domain-driven principles and has since been enhanced to incorporate more advanced data structures.

I chose this artifact because it reflects my growth in both software engineering and algorithmic thinking. Specifically, the second enhancement introduced a Trie data structure to support efficient prefix-based searching for first names, last names, and task names. Initially, I considered replacing the Map entirely with a Trie, but through deeper research and experimentation, I realized that combining both structures would yield better performance and flexibility. The Map remains optimal for exact ID and field lookups, while the Trie excels at scalable prefix search. This decision shows my ability to evaluate trade-offs and apply data structures in a way that solves real-world problems effectively.

This enhancement directly supports my targeted course outcomes related to applying algorithms and data structures to software problems. In fact, I exceeded my original goals by not just implementing a Trie but thoughtfully integrating it in a way that improved both efficiency and design clarity.

The process of enhancing this artifact taught me a great deal about balancing theoretical knowledge with practical constraints. I deepened my understanding of how Tries work internally, how they manage memory, and how they interact with other structures like Maps. One of the biggest challenges was deciding whether to replace or augment the Map. Through testing and reflection, I concluded that using both was the most effective solution. I also reinforced my commitment to encapsulation and modular design by keeping the Trie implementation separate and integrating validation through a centralized utility class.
